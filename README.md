# Location-Aware-Websocket-Server for Java
Server that is used for the Location Aware App Find a Char Made by Ian van de Poll and Lars Verhulst.
This server is made in Java. There is also a edition based on C# (under development).

You start the server in the Main.class in the public static void main(..);
There is also a SQL file included so that you can use our Database design if you want.

We used https://github.com/TooTallNate/Java-WebSocket for our websocket framework.
This framework has great documentation and perfect support for servers and android devices.
